# NOTES

- From a browser compatibility standpoint, .MP3 and .MP4 are the best audio file formats for use on the Web. 
All modern browsers support this format, including IE9. Other formats that are supported by most browsers include OGG, WebM, AAC, and WAV.

- Impossible to prevent users from downloading audio files through dev tools (?)
